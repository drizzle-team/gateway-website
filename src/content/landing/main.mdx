<Callout collapsed="How it works?">
Drizzle Studio server hosts an admin panel, which you can visit on `host:port`.

Drizzle Gateway is compatible with both `arm` and `amd` architectures, you can use it on both MacOS(intel/m chips) and linux, whichever you prefer.

It runs a Drizzle Gateway Server on `:4983` port, you can override it by providing `PORT` environment variable if needed.
IMPORTANT: make sure to mount a persistent storage with `/app` root for Docker container, itâ€™s required to have a place where to store your session and recover on server restarts.

To override `/app` root path - provide `STORE_PATH` environment variable.

You can provide `MASTERPASS` env variably to have protected admin access, it will also unlock the `passcode` feature which you will be able to set for others to have protected access and without ability to change passcode.
